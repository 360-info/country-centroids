## `/data`

Two files are available:

- [`data/centroids-oflargestpoly.csv`](data/centroids-oflargestpoly.csv): centroids of countries using the largest polygon
- [`data/centroids.csv`](data/centroids.csv): centroids of countries using _all_ polygons

If you don't want centroids that might be in the water for countries with several landmasses, use the former. otherwise, use the latter.
